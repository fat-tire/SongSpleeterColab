I'm just putting it in a slightly-easier click-through format within a Google Collaboratory web page.  [Deezer's github page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) also offers a [similar demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb), but this one here makes it very easy to upload your own songs + download the results.  It also uses the GPU version for faster processing.*\n",

        "**Spleeter** is a deep learning network that can separate (split, or \"spleet\") a singer(s) vocals from the music.  You give it a \"song.mp3\", and it gives you two mp3s out: \"vocals.mp3\" and \"accompaniment.mp3\".  Spleeter supports various dimensions of separation, but the demo here just spleets into two parts (or \"stems\").  Deezer provides more details [here](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/README.md), including instructions for the other audio separation stems:  vocals, bass, drums, piano, & other.\n",
