## What's this?

This is a Colab "click-through" [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) intended to make it a bit easier for non-technical people to "spleet" their own songs (see Disclaimer below).  See @deezer's original repository at the [Spleeter github page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter)

To start spleeting, visit [this link!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fat-tire/SongSpleeterColab/blob/master/Song_Spleeter_Colab.ipynb)
